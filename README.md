The door lock security system project aims to provide a secure and versatile method for controlling access to a door using both RFID cards and a keypad-based password entry system. This system utilizes UART communication for RFID card reading and direct keypad input for password entry. The system is equipped with various components such as an RFID reader module, a keypad, an LCD for visual feedback and supporting tools like a breadboard, capacitors, crystal oscillator, potentiometer, and jumpers.
